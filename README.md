Connect Four

## Project Description
> 
It will be based on the game Connect Four. The game consists of a 6 row*7 column grid and has red and yellow disks as game pieces. The game is played by two players taking turns. On each player's turn, they drop a piece from the top of the board, and the piece falls to the lowest available space. A player will win if they line up four pieces of their color in a row, column, or diagonal.
